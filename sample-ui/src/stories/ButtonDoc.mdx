</Canvas>

Above example shows all state including icon on the left and right in normal size buttons. This component takes `icon` as a `ReactNode` type so you can put anything (literally anything with type `ReactNode`) as your icon and customize it freely. We only set some styles for an icon in case you use a 24dp based icon font like Material icons but you can still customize the styles to match your preferences.

## Sizes

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--sizes" />
</Canvas>

All button variants can be used along with `size` prop.

## Shapes

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--shapes" />
</Canvas>

The `pill` button is the same as normal, all the different is only a border radius style. The squared and rounded button hide your text even if you assign to it. But it takes `leftIcon` or `rightIcon` and display it in the middle. Of course, it changes size accordingly.
